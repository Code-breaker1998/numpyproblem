    <h1>Durgesh's Website</h1>
    <p><strong>Censorship</strong> of Wikipedia has occurred in several countries, including China, France, Germany, Iran, Pakistan, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Thailand, Tunisia, Turkey, the United Kingdom, Uzbekistan, and Venezuela.
        Some instances are examples of widespread internet censorship in general that includes Wikipedia content.
        Others are indicative of measures to prevent the viewing of specific content deemed offensive.
        <q>The length of different blocks have varied from days to years.</q>
    <blockquote>When Wikipedia ran on the HTTP protocol, governments were able to block specific articles.</blockquote>
        However, in 2011 Wikipedia began running on HTTPS as well, and in 2015 switched over entirely.[1]
        Since then, the only censorship option has been to block the entire site for a particular language, which has resulted in some countries dropping their bans and others expanding their bans to the entire site.
        Wikipedia is currently blocked in China since 23 April 2019</p>
